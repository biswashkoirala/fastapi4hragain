This is a program to perform CRUD in fastapi using SQLite. 
We have done similar program before but now it has used jinja2.

jinja2 is used to add HTML pages to this site. 
For now only basic html is used just to learn adding HTML pages support and add HTML buttons only.
These buttons point to localhost/docs but at least they can guide us what to check in this program.
